    <h1>Birthday Invitation</h1>
    <h2>Heartly Welcome to all of you on my special day</h2>
    <h3>20th November</h3>
    <p>The birthday is a time to celebrate and we all have different outlooks when it comes to celebrating birthdays. Some like to party outside, some prefer being at home and enjoy with family, some like to do get together with friends, and some want to party at home with close ones. Everyone has a different way to celebrate. Obviously, for such celebration we donâ€™t print invitation cards, so, we call friends sharing birthday invitation wording through message. The birthday invitation wordings are informal invitations that share celebration details. These invitations are an attractive piece of information. We have an amazing collection of birthday invitation wordings for birthdays of different age groups.</p>
